# AI for Geolocation - Beating Geoguessr

As part of a course project on **Computer Vision**, [Mathieu Gierski](https://github.com/MathieuGie) and [I](https://github.com/MaxxiPaxxi) have been working on the development of different models to try to predict locations of pictures from Geoguessr to try to beat the game.
Throughout development we have gone through several iterations of trying:
- ResNet;
- Pretrained Resnet;
- CNN;
- Clustered-CNN;
- ViT.

Please do read the presentation slides for a more detailed understanding of the project.
This repository does need some cleaning out to make it structured. Please check back later for more descriptions of the project and tasks.
